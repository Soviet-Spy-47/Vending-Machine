# Vending Machine

Use the given file to create a vending machine and manage the contents using this same file.
There are different types of items the vending machine can hold.

Your goal is to make a way for users to add money to their account, access the menu of items, choose the item they want (which reduces their account balance), then update the sales report.

You can assume the inventory is limitless, or implement a way to track the count of each item remaining.
